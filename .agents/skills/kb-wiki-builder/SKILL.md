# kb-wiki-builder

Automates the transition of information from raw, unprocessed text to structured canonical knowledge using the Open Knowledge Format (OKF).

## When to use

- You have just fetched new raw documentation or release notes into the `raw/` directory.
- You need to update the canonical wiki files based on the new raw data.
- The user asks you to extract facts and create a structured overview for a product.

## Rules for Extraction

1. **No Hallucination:** Only extract claims that are explicitly stated in the `raw/` files. Do not invent features or guess compatibility.
2. **OKF Format:** All generated wiki files MUST include a strict YAML frontmatter.
3. **Location:** Save the generated files in the canonical knowledge root (e.g., `kb/overview.md` or `kb/apps/<app>/overview.md`), NEVER in `raw/`.

## OKF Markdown Template

Use this exact structure for the generated files:

```markdown
---
id: <PREFIX>-<NUMBER> (e.g., APP-001)
title: "<Clear, descriptive title>"
category: "<e.g., concept, architecture, setup>"
tags: [tag1, tag2]
status: active
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
environment:
  os: any
  shell: any
  tools: []
error_signatures: []
---

# <Title>

## Описание (Overview)
Brief description of the concept or component.

## Ключевые возможности / Факты (Key Facts)
- Fact 1
- Fact 2

## References (Источники)
- [Raw Source Name](./raw/<source_file>.md)
```

## Workflow

1. Read the target raw file via context-mode tools.
2. Draft the OKF document based on the template.
3. Write the file to its proper location.
4. (Optional) Run `qmd update` using `qmd-operator` so the new wiki file is searchable.
