# qmd-operator

Manage the local QMD (Semantic Search) workspace. This skill allows agents to configure QMD collections, update the vector index, and query the documentation.

## When to use

- You need to search for facts in product documentation.
- You just downloaded raw release notes or docs into `kb/raw/` (or `kb/apps/<app>/raw/`) and need to update the QMD index.
- You need to create a new QMD collection.

## Commands

### 1. Update the Index
After adding new files to the knowledge base:
```bash
qmd update
```

List configured collections:
```bash
qmd collection list
```

### 2. Search and Query
To perform a fast keyword or semantic search across a specific collection:
```bash
qmd search "<keywords>" -c <collection_name>
```

For a complex semantic query specifying intent:
```bash
qmd query "intent: <what you are looking for>\nlex: <keywords>" -c <collection_name>
```

### 3. Read a Document
If QMD returns a reference to a file (e.g., `qmd://my-app/raw/releases.md`), use the context-mode tools to read the actual file from the disk.

## Configuring a New Collection
To define what files belong to a specific context, create a YAML file in `qmd/collections/<name>.yaml`:
```yaml
name: <collection_name>
description: "Knowledge base for <collection_name>"
paths:
  - "../../kb/"
exclude:
  - "**/.DS_Store"
```
Then run `qmd update` to register it.
